To run Cassandra in the foreground with highest debugging levels the following steps should be followed:

1. Edit conf/log4j-server.properties:
	Log4j.rootLogger=DEBUG, stdout, R
	
2. Start the instance using f:
	$ bin/Cassandra -f



Cluster Configuration:

1. SSH into all nodes and change the following things in the cassandra.yaml file found in /etc/cassandra/conf/ folder

2. cluster_name: 'cmpe295A' ; seeds: ip1, ip2, ip3, ip4,ip5

3. listen_address: ip1 ; rpc_address: ip1

4. IP addresses are the private IP addresses assigned to the ec2 (we use private ip as they do not change unless ec2 is terminated)

5. listen_address and rpc_address will change to ips of the corresponding ec2.

6. start the cassandra service in each node using the command:
	a. ‘sudo service cassandra start’

7. check the cluster status using the following command
	b. ‘nodetool status’
