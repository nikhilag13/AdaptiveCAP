# Clustering Algorithm

The project aims to improves the latency of a distributed environment by clustering the network. This would save the time to replicate the data among all the nodes thereby improving the latency. As the cluster size increases certain threshold the algorithm starts clustering to optimize the data transfer within the network. This reduces the hop count and hence energy is saved. The algorithm proposes have many local cluster heads instead of a single cluster head to offload the responsivity of the routing and data transfer within the network.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```

```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
python app.py
```
